DISCLAIMER - ABANDONED/UNMAINTAINED CODE / DO NOT USE
=======================================================
While this repository has been inactive for some time, this formal notice, issued on **December 10, 2024**, serves as the official declaration to clarify the situation. Consequently, this repository and all associated resources (including related projects, code, documentation, and distributed packages such as Docker images, PyPI packages, etc.) are now explicitly declared **unmaintained** and **abandoned**.

I would like to remind everyone that this project’s free license has always been based on the principle that the software is provided "AS-IS", without any warranty or expectation of liability or maintenance from the maintainer.
As such, it is used solely at the user's own risk, with no warranty or liability from the maintainer, including but not limited to any damages arising from its use.

Due to the enactment of the Cyber Resilience Act (EU Regulation 2024/2847), which significantly alters the regulatory framework, including penalties of up to €15M, combined with its demands for **unpaid** and **indefinite** liability, it has become untenable for me to continue maintaining all my Open Source Projects as a natural person.
The new regulations impose personal liability risks and create an unacceptable burden, regardless of my personal situation now or in the future, particularly when the work is done voluntarily and without compensation.

**No further technical support, updates (including security patches), or maintenance, of any kind, will be provided.**

These resources may remain online, but solely for public archiving, documentation, and educational purposes.

Users are strongly advised not to use these resources in any active or production-related projects, and to seek alternative solutions that comply with the new legal requirements (EU CRA).

**Using these resources outside of these contexts is strictly prohibited and is done at your own risk.**

This project has been transfered to Makina Corpus <freesoftware@makina-corpus.com> ( https://makina-corpus.com ). This project and its associated resources, including published resources related to this project (e.g., from PyPI, Docker Hub, GitHub, etc.), may be removed starting **March 15, 2025**, especially if the CRA’s risks remain disproportionate.

# NagVis - Visualize monitoring data

NagVis is a program for visualizing the data the monitoring core of your choice,
for example Nagios, Naemon, Icinga or Shinken, in a human friendly way.

Instead of rendering all your data in flat tables of hosts and service data
which do not tell the user anything about relations between the object, in
NagVis you can create a view on your objects which makes even non technical
users understand the relations beteen your systems and services. This way
visualized it is easy for the users to realize which components are affected by
an occuring problem.

Besides manually created maps it is possible the create so called automaps
which visualize the parent/child relations between hosts or geomaps which
are meant to show objects based on the geographical coordinates. These
maps are currently only meant to be static, there is no browsing or zooming
possible like in Open Street Map or Google Maps.

## Installation

### OMD

There are different ways to install NagVis. The *best* way to an easily
maintainable monitoring environment is to use [OMD](http://omdistro.org), the
Open Monitoring Distribution. Everything you need comes in a single package.
You will be ready to monitor within just a couple of minutes.

### Manual installation

The *classic* way is to install NagVis is to use the installer script which
will ask you a couple of questions and then tries to do the right thing to
provide you with a working installation.

First you need to download NagVis. The released versions can be found on
[nagvis.org](http://nagvis.org/).

Unpack the archive to a temporary place (for example /tmp), then change to
that directory.

```
# tar xvzf nagvis-1.*.tar.gz /tmp
# cd /tmp/nagvis-1.*
```

Now execute the installer and follow the instructions.

```
# ./install.sh
```

Once you are finished with the installer, you can remove the source directory.

```
# rm -rf /tmp/nagvis-1.*
```

*Hint:* The installer can be called with command line parameters to e.g.
avoid interactive questions during installation. For details launch the
installer with the `-h` option.
